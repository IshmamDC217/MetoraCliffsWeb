# Metora Cliff's Website 

## Introduction
Metora Cliffs is a progressive rock band based in Leeds and Manchester, UK, inspired by video game music. We seek to combine our passion for nostalgic video game soundtracks with a modern progressive rock sound to create a unique and powerful musical experience.

For this project I am using Next.js to create our portfolio, to showcase our music, videos, and upcoming dates for our shows/gigs. We are utilizing modern libraries and frameworks to create a website that is both visually appealing and functional.

Our website is designed to be user friendly and will feature our music, videos, and upcoming dates for our gigs in an easy to find format. We also plan to use our website to promote our music and allow fans to purchase our merchandise from the website.
